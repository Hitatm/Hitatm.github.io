The Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function (MRHOF)
This implementation uses the estimated number of transmissions (ETX) 
as the additive routing metric, and also provides stubs for the energy metric.

ETX_SCALE                                 100
ETX_ALPHA                                90
MAX_LINK_METRIC			10    //Reject parents that have a higher link metric than the following
MAX_PATH_COST			100      // Reject parents that have a higher path cost than the following.
PARENT_SWITCH_THRESHOLD_DIV	         2

RPL_MIN_HOPRANKINC          256          ////


Select routing metric supported at runtime. This must be a valid
DAG Metric Container Object Type (see below). Currently, we only 
support RPL_DAG_MC_ETX and RPL_DAG_MC_ENERGY.
 When MRHOF (RFC6719) is used with ETX, no metric container must
 be used; instead the rank carries ETX directly.


p_metric=p->rank+nbr->link_metric         //p和nbr的链路地址相同

new_rank=base_rank+rank_increase;          //基于  the new rank information from DIO    
base_rank=p->rank , rank_increase = nbr->link_metric;

nbr->link_metric = new_etx;                            //基于发包返回的状态
packet_etx = 256;     recorded_etx=nbr->limk_metric
 if(status == MAC_TX_NOACK) {
      packet_etx =10 * 256;
    }
最初：new_etx = packet_etx
迭代:  new_etx = ((uint32_t)recorded_etx * 90 +
                 (uint32_t)packet_etx * (100 - 90)) / 100
